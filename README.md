# CadQuery action

This action runs [CadQuery](https://github.com/CadQuery/cadquery) to build your models emulating
the [CQ-editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor).

## Features

- Automatically test your model(s) in your CI/CD pipeline
- Automatically build the latest version of your model(s) for release.
- No boilerplate: use the same code from the [CQ-editor](https://github.com/CadQuery/CQ-editor) and in your CI/CD
  pipeline.
- WIP: Build a static website to showcase your latest model(s) automatically.
- WIP: Take a screenshot of your model(s) and use it as a preview image.

## Usage

This repository also serves as a demo. See [demo.py](demo.py) and the [workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for more
details.
